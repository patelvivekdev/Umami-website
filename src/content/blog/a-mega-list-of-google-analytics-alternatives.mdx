Understanding website data is crucial for marketers to know how their customers, users, and visitors engage with their content. Google Analytics is
usually the de facto tool for providing these insights into website traffic because it’s easy and free. However, easy and free isn’t always the best
way to go because Google Analytics practices regarding privacy and data are concerning. Like most Google products, Google Analytics is free because
Google collects data and then uses it to make money through its other products, such as Google Ads.

As marketers, we are still supposed to produce outcomes, so we must use tools like Google Analytics regardless of privacy concerns. However, is there
a happy medium between delivering results and respecting user privacy? Many marketers seek alternatives to Google Analytics that prioritize user
privacy and data ownership.

This blog post explores 60 Google Analytics alternatives, a brief breakdown of each, key features, and whether they are cookie-free, GDPR compliant,
CCPA compliant, open source, and allow for data ownership. As always, information and features are constantly evolving, so please refer to the website
of each analytics tool for the latest features.

# Why Marketers Search for Google Analytics Alternatives

Google Analytics collects a range of data about user behavior on a website, including user location, device type, user behavior, referral source,
and demographic information. This data is then used to create user profiles that can be targeted by advertising campaigns in Google Ads. While
this type of advertising can be effective, it raises concerns about user privacy and consent.

Users may need to be made aware that their data is being tracked, and they should be informed and give their consent for their data to be used in
this way. Additionally, there are concerns about the accuracy of the data collected by Google and the potential for data breaches.

To address these concerns, website owners are turning to alternative analytics tools, prioritizing user privacy and providing greater transparency
and control over personal data. Some of these tools, like Umami, offer similar features to Google Analytics but with a significantly greater focus
on user privacy.
