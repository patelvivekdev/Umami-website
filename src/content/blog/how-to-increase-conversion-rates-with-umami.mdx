# How to Increase Conversion Rates With Umami

Marketers need a reliable and user-friendly web analytics solution to improve conversion rates. They constantly seek ways to optimize their efforts and drive meaningful business outcomes, such as increasing sales, generating more leads, or improving customer engagement. Once marketers launch a campaign, they continuously monitor it and adjust it based on data.

In this blog post, we'll explore how to use Umami for conversion rate optimization (CRO), explore key features, review setting up Umami, and provide actionable strategies to boost conversion rates.

## An Overview of Umami for Conversion Rate Optimization

Umami can support your CRO strategy quite easily. Let's take a closer look at some of these key features:

1. **Custom Event Tracking**: Whether it's button clicks, form submissions, or purchases, Umami allows you to set up custom events easily. Custom events allow you to have the analytics infrastructure necessary for CRO. Tracking events lets you understand what marketing campaigns produce outcomes and gives you the data you need to optimize your conversion funnel.

2. **Real-time data**: See how changes to your website impact user behavior immediately.

3. **UTM Tracking**: Understanding which traffic sources and campaigns are driving the most conversions is essential. Umami simplifies this process by automatically detecting if the traffic you drive to your website has UTM parameters in the URL. You can quickly determine which channels and initiatives yield the best results.

4. **Funnel Analysis**: Understanding the user journey is critical to CRO. Umami's funnel reporting feature visually represents the user journey, highlighting drop-off points and areas where users abandon your conversion process.

## Umami's A/B testing capabilities

Umami’s filtering capabilities allow you to review the performance of two pages on your website quickly. By analyzing key metrics, events, UTMs, etc,  you can determine which version resonates best with your audience and drives the most conversions. This data-driven approach to A/B testing encourages you to experiment, innovate, and continuously optimize your website for maximum impact.

For example, create an A- and B-version of a landing page and test it, which produces outcomes across different marketing tactics such as paid, email, social, etc. Umami can quickly surface this information.

## Actionable Strategies to Boost Conversion Rates with Umami

With Umami, you can implement various strategies to boost your conversion rates. Here are some actionable tips to get you started:

1. **Identify and prioritize high-converting traffic sources**: By leveraging Umami's UTM tracking capabilities, you can determine which traffic sources and campaigns drive the most conversions. Once you've identified these high-performing channels, double down on your efforts and allocate more of your marketing budget to them. This targeted approach ensures that you maximize your ROI and focus on the most profitable areas of your marketing mix.

    For example, if you’re using UTM parameters on your URLs, you can quickly determine which Google Ads campaign, Ad Group, Keyword, etc, are producing outcomes and which are not. Based on this data, you can run ad copy, keyword, and landing page experiments to continue to narrow down what works for you with Google Ads (or maybe you determine Google Ads doesn’t work, and it’s time to dial down the budget).

2. **Optimize landing pages for maximum impact**: Using landing pages is the most important part of the CRO process with Umami. They are usually the destination of marketing campaigns. Use Umami's URL filtering feature to analyze the performance of individual or multiple landing pages, paying close attention to metrics such as bounce rates, custom events, etc. Identify pages that are underperforming and make targeted improvements to enhance their effectiveness. This could involve simplifying the design, clarifying the call-to-action, adding social proof, or streamlining the user experience.

    For example, you produce two different landing pages with different button CTAs. Each of those buttons can be set up as a custom event and tracked separately inside Umami’s dashboard, which gives you a clear view of which button has more clicks based on marketing campaign/UTM parameters.

3. **Streamline the user journey to minimize friction**: A smooth, intuitive user journey is essential for driving conversions. Umami's funnel reporting feature allows you to visualize the path users take on your website, highlighting any drop-off points or areas of friction. By identifying these pain points, you can make strategic changes to your website to guide users toward conversion. This may involve simplifying the website nav, reducing the number of clicks in your checkout process, or providing more precise information to address common user concerns.

4. **Embrace a culture of continuous testing and iteration**: Conversion rate optimization requires constant testing and improvement. Umami's real-time data enables you to test multiple variations of your website, landing pages, and marketing campaigns, making data-driven decisions and iterating based on real-time results. Creating a culture of experimentation within your marketing team, encouraging everyone to suggest ideas, test hypotheses, and learn from successes and failures. By fostering a mindset of continuous optimization, you'll be well-positioned to maximize your conversion rates over time.

3. **Set up custom events**: Once you've identified your conversion actions, it's time to set up custom events in Umami. This process involves adding a few lines of JavaScript code to the relevant elements on your website. Don't worry; you don’t need to be a coding expert to do this.

4. **Implement UTM parameters**: To leverage Umami's UTM tracking capabilities fully, make sure to include UTM parameters in your marketing campaign URLs.
