# Environment variables

You can configure Umami with the use of environment variables. They go into the same `.env` file as your `DATABASE_URL`.

---

## Runtime variables

Runtime variables are recognized when Umami is running. You can set your environment variables prior to starting the application.

**APP_SECRET = &lt;random string&gt;**

A unique value for your installation.

**CLIENT_IP_HEADER = &lt;header name&gt;**

HTTP header to check for the client's IP address. This is useful when you're
behind a proxy that uses non-standard headers.

**CLOUD_MODE = 1**

Disables `users`, `teams`, and `websites` settings page.

**COLLECT_API_ENDPOINT = &lt;API endpoint&gt;**

Allows you to send metrics to a location different than the default `/api/send`. This is to help you avoid some [ad blockers](/docs/guides/bypass-ad-blockers).

**CORS_MAX_AGE = &lt;number&gt;**

How many seconds a CORS preflight should last. Default is 24 hours.

**DATABASE_URL = &lt;connection string&gt;**

Connection string for your database. This is the only required variable.

**DEBUG = &lt;debug value&gt;**

Console logging for specific areas of the application. Values include `umami:auth`, `umami:clickhouse`, `umami:kafka`, `umami:middleware`, and `umami:prisma`.

**DISABLE_BOT_CHECK = 1**

By default bots are excluded from statistics. This disables checking for bots.

**DISABLE_LOGIN = 1**

Disables the login page for the application.

**DISABLE_UPDATES = 1**

Disables the check for new versions of Umami.

**DISABLE_TELEMETRY = 1**

Umami collects completely anonymous telemetry data in order help improve the application. You can choose to disable this if you don't want to participate.

**ENABLE_TEST_CONSOLE = 1**

Enables the internal test page, `{host}/console`. Admin access is required. Users can manually fire pageviews and events to their websites.

**HOSTNAME = &lt;hostname&gt;** / **PORT = &lt;port number&gt;**

If you are running on an environment which requires you to bind to a specific hostname or port, such as Heroku, you can add
these variables and start your app with `npm run start-env` instead of `npm start`.

**IGNORE_IP = &lt;ip addresses or ranges&gt;**

You can provide a comma-delimited list of IP addresses and ranges to exclude from data collection.

**LOG_QUERY = 1**

If you are running in development mode, this will log database queries to the console for debugging.

**PRIVATE_MODE = 1**

Disables all external network calls. Note, this will also disable all website icons since they come from duckduckgo.com.

**REMOVE_TRAILING_SLASH = 1**

Removes the trailing slash from all incoming urls.

**TRACKER_SCRIPT_NAME = &lt;script name&gt;**

Allows you to assign a custom name to the tracker script different from the default `script.js`. This is to help you avoid some [ad blockers](/docs/guides/bypass-ad-blockers).

The `.js` extension is not required. The value can also be any path you choose, for example `/path/to/tracker`.

## Build time variables

Build time variables are only recognized during the build process. This also includes building custom Docker images. You need to set your environment variables prior to building the application.

**ALLOWED_FRAME_URLS = &lt;urls&gt;**

A space-delimited list of urls allowed to host the application in an iframe.

**BASE_PATH = &lt;path&gt;**

If you want to host Umami under a subdirectory. You may need to update your reverse proxy settings to correctly handle the BASE_PATH prefix.

**DATABASE_TYPE = &lt;postgresql | mysql&gt;**

The type of DB to be used. This is only required for the Docker build.

**FORCE_SSL = 1**

This will send a HTTP `Strict-Transport-Security` response header with all requests. See [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security).

**SKIP_DB_CHECK = 1**

Skips the `check-db` step in the build process. Used for Docker builds.
